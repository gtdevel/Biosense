This is an app I developed for my bachelor project at Carleton University. It has a few basic components. 
It was made to communicate via Bluetooth with a custom ECG (heart signal) recorder. The main functionalities are the
following:
- Connect to custom ECG device over bluetooth
- Plot ECG signal
- Upload ECG data to Google Spreadsheets file on Google Drive
- Track and store GPS tracking data
